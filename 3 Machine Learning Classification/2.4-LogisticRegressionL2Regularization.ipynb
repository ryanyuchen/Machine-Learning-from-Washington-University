    "The goal of this second notebook is to implement your own logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization. You will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.\n",
    " * Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.\n",
    " * Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with an L2 penalty with respect to a single coefficient.\n",
    " * Implement gradient ascent with an L2 penalty.\n",
    " * Empirically explore how the L2 penalty can ameliorate overfitting."
